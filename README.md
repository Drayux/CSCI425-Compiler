### Unnamed Compiler: Basic lexer and compiler framework

### IMPORTANT TODO:
Debug convert_nfa or output_table (probably output!): transition table files are wrong!

## Course Affiliation  
This project was originally made as an extention of CSCI425: Compiler Design at Colorado School of Mines.  
The final goal of this project is to serve as the compiler for a language of my own design, TBA.  

## Targets  
Building this repository will create multiple executables.  
Currently, the generated executables are as follows:  
`DEBUG` | An executable meant to be a testing ground for various data structures and conversion results  
`MATCH` | An executable that currently takes an NFA and converts it to a DFA and generates the respective transition table. (File formats are specified as below.) This will later be extended to parse REGEX tokens into transition tables for use in modular token matching.  

## File Formats  
To be written. See the docs/ directory...
